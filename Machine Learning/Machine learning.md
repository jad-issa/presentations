### The brain as the master processor
###### A presentation by <small> Jad Issa </small>

---

## So... What does this thing mean?

--- 

## Wait! Are the machines going to kill us like in sci-fi movies?

---

## But can a machine learn by itself? (hint: yes!)

---

## Uses in ordinary life of machine learning: 
- Facial recognition (Facebook, camera apps, etc...)
- Speech recognition (Google Now, Apple Siri, etc...)
- Optical character recognition (scanning text)
- Forecasts into the future (weather, prices, anything really)
- Classification of diseases (types of cancer, etc...)
- Evaluation of health risks
- Self-driving cars

---

## OK, I got it, but we still do it better, so I think we're safe, right? (No!)

---

## Examples of superhuman artificial intelligence
- Calculation
- Big data processing
- Data sharing
- Logical thinking
- Maths in general (better than most of us :P)
- Digit recognition
- Chess

# But how can it do so?

# How is the data processed?

Our neural network

---

## Goal: be less wrong (a.k.a heuristic thinking)
1. Start with random weights
2. Improve it to be **less wrong**
3. Repeat
4. Just accept it when it's good enough

# My philosophy of automation and upgrade
### (or how machine learning matters to you)

---

### Does that mean we won't work anymore?
# Not yet!

---

## Education in light of machine learning

---

## The natural way we learn stuff

---

## The way modern education works

## The teenage liberation handbook

### Does that mean we should quit school?

# <big>Not really...</big>

# Ethics of machine learning

---

### Some dangerous uses of machine learning
- DARPA's automatic drones (and military uses in general)
- Big corporation automatic spies (1984 gets practical)
- Make humans seem insignificate, rather useless.
- Make dangerous gene manipulation practical (Brave New World materializes before 2050)
- Destroy art by making art clones (prole music)

## Explore machine learning and its potential
##### Papers will be distributed to you

---

## Can you help me get involved?

---

## What if I don't want to code?

---

## Special thanks to:
- Sister Maddalena for helping make this possible at school
- Nadine Majdalene for organizing the logistics
- All those who inspired me to follow my passion
